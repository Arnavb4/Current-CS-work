# Instructions:
# 1) Run this code, look at the code and output carefully.
# Decide what the symbol < does.

#print(example(4.9))
#print(example(5))
#print(example(5.1))
#print(example(6))

# 2) Replace the < symbol with a <= symbol.
#    Decide what the symbol <= does.
#
# 3) Replace the <= symbol with a > symbol.
#    Decide what the symbol > does.
#
# 4) Replace the > symbol with a >= symbol.
#    Decide what the symbol >= does.
#
# 5) Replace the >= symbol with a == symbol.
#    Decide what the symbol == does.
#
# 6) Replace the == symbol with a != symbol.
#    Decide what the symbol != does.
#
# 7) What if you use a single equal sign, a = symbol?
#    What happens?



# Then, delete these three quote marks AND the three quote marks at the bottom of the code.
# (This is another way to comment out large blocks of code - surround them with two sets of
# triple quotes!)

# 8) Run this code, look at the code and output carefully.
#    Guess what the symbol % does.

# 9) Change the 2 inside the mystery function to a 3.
#    Run the code again.  Does your theory still work?
#
# 10) Change the 3 inside the mystery function to a 4.
#    Run the code again.
#
# 11) What does the % symbol do?
# It finds the reminder when dividing.
