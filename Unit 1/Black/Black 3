That code is too complex for me to understand and trace just from looking at it

Here's what I recommend - add these lines:

def sort_string_helper (x, y, z):
    print("just called sort_string_helper with", x, y, z)
    input()
    if y == len(x):
        return sort_string_helper2 (x, z)
    ...etc
Then when you run your code, you'll see that print statement happen once, 
and then because of input(), your code will pause until you hit enter in the terminal.  
Take a moment to think: "if my code is working, the next print statement should say ..." 
and decide what x, y, and z you're expecting.  Then hit enter and see what you get for the next call.

This has two benefits - one, you make sure you really understand the problem by making sure you know what should 
come next, and two, you understand exactly what your code is doing and where it falls short.
